#### Create a new virtual machine (multi-platform)

```bash
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1
```

<Callout>Replace `myvm1` with your desired VM name.</Callout>

#### Create a new virtual machine using Hyper-V on Windows 10 (specify virtual switch)

```bash
docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" myvm1
```

<Callout>
  Replace `myswitch` with the actual name of your Hyper-V virtual switch and
  `myvm1` with your desired VM name.
</Callout>

#### View information about a VM

```bash
docker-machine env myvm1
```

<Callout>Replace `myvm1` with the name of your existing VM.</Callout>

#### List nodes in a swarm (requires SSH access to the VM)

```bash
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node ls"
```

<Callout>
  Replace `myvm1` with the name of your VM running the swarm master.
</Callout>

#### Inspect a specific node in a swarm (requires SSH access to the VM)

```bash
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node inspect <node ID>"
```

<Callout>Replace `<node ID>` with the actual ID of the node you want to inspect. You can get this ID from the previous command's output.</Callout>

#### View worker join token for a swarm (requires SSH access to the VM)

```bash
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm join-token -q worker"
```

<Callout>
  {" "}
  Replace `myvm1` with the name of your VM running a swarm worker.
</Callout>

#### Open an SSH session to a VM

```bash
docker-machine ssh myvm1
```

<Callout>
  Replace `myvm1` with the name of your VM. Type "exit" to end the SSH session.
</Callout>

#### Make a worker leave the swarm (requires SSH access to the VM)

```bash
docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm leave"
```

<Callout>
  Replace `myvm2` with the name of the worker VM you want to remove from the
  swarm.
</Callout>

#### Force a swarm master to leave and shut down the swarm (requires SSH access to the VM)

```bash
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm leave -f"
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Use this command with caution as it will disrupt the entire swarm.
</Callout>

#### Start a stopped VM

```bash
docker-machine start myvm1
```

<Callout>Replace `myvm1` with the name of your stopped VM.</Callout>

#### Stop all running VMs

```bash
docker-machine stop $(docker-machine ls -q)
```

<Callout type="warn">
  This command will stop all running VMs. Use with caution!
</Callout>

#### Delete all VMs and their disk images

```bash
docker-machine rm $(docker-machine ls -q)
```

<Callout type="warn">
  This command will permanently delete all VMs and their associated disk images.
  Use with extreme caution!
</Callout>

#### Copy a file to a VM (requires SSH access to the VM)

```bash
docker-machine scp docker-compose.yml myvm1:~
```

#### Deploy an application using docker-compose on a VM (requires SSH access to the VM)

```bash
docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker stack deploy -c <file> <app>"
```

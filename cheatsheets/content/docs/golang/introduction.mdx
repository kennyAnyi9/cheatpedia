## Hello World

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello Gophers!")
}
```

<Callout title="Execution">
 1. It declares the `main` package, which is required for executable programs in Go.
 2. It imports the `fmt` package, which provides formatting and printing functions.
 3. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
 4. Inside `main()`, it uses `fmt.Println()` to print "Hello Gophers!" to the console.

</Callout>

### Go Modules

<Callout title="">
  Go projects are called `modules`. Each module has multiple `packages` Each
  package should has a scoped functionality. Packages talk to each other to
  compose the code. A module needs at least one package, the `main`. The package
  main needs a entry function called `main`.
</Callout>

#### Create Module

```bash
$ go mod init [name]
```

<Callout title="Tip">
  By convention, modules names has the follow structure:
  `domain.com/user/module/package`.
  <br /> Example: `github.com/spf13/cobra`

title: Methods and Interfaces
description: Goland methods and interfaces

Go doesn't have classes. But you can implement methods, interfaces and almost everything contained in OOP, but in what gophers call "Go Way"

```go
type Dog struct {
    Name string
}

func (dog *Dog) bark() string {
    return dog.Name + " is barking!"
}

dog := Dog{"Rex"}
dog.bark() // Rex is barking!
```

Interfaces are implicitly implemented. You don't need to inform that your struct are correctly implementing a interface if it already has all methods with the same name of the interface.
All structs implement the `interface{}` interface. This empty interface means the same as `any`.

```go
// Car implements Vehicle interface
type Vehicle interface {
    Accelerate()
}

type Car struct {

}

func (car *Car) Accelerate() {
    return "Car is moving on ground"
}
```

## Pointers

Pointers are a direct reference to a memory address that some variable or value is being stored.

```go
// Pointers has *T type
var value int
var pointer *int

// Point to a variable memory address with &
value = 3
pointer = &value

pointer // 3
pointer = 20
pointer // 20
pointer += 5
pointer // 25

// Pointers to structs can access the attributes
type Struct struct {
    X int
}

s := Struct{3}
pointer := &s

s.X // 3
```

Obs: Unlike C, Go doesn't have pointer arithmetics.

```

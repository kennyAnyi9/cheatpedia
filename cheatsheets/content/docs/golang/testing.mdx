Go has a built-in library to unit testing. In a separate file you insert tests for functionalities of a file and run `go test package` to run all tests of the actual package or `go test path` to run a specific test file.

```go
// main.go
func Sum(x, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

// main_test.go
import (
    "testing"
    "reflect"
)

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
    x, y := 2, 4
    expected := 2 + 4

    if !reflect.DeepEqual(Sum(x, y), expected) {
        t.Fatalf("Function Sum not working as expected")
    }
}
```

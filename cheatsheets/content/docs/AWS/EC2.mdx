<Callout>
 We need to specify a region to use ec2 commands. We can configure a default region with "aws configure" or set the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variable before the command line

Example: `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 aws ec2 describe-instances`

</Callout>

#### Desribe all instances in the current region

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances
```

<Callout>
  This command shows details about your EC2 instances in the current region. It
  covers running instances by default, but you can include stopped ones with
  --include-all-instances. Use filters to target specific sets of instances for
  management tasks.
</Callout>

#### Describe specific instances by their IDs

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance_id_1> <instance_id_2>
```

<Callout>
  This command lets you view information about specific EC2 instances by
  providing their unique IDs (e.g., `aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids
  i-0123456789abcdef0 i-0fedcba0987654321`). This is useful when you want
  details on a particular set of instances, rather than seeing information on
  all instances in your region.
</Callout>

#### Filter and describe instances by name

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=<instance_name>
```

<Callout>
  This command allows you to find and view details about EC2 instances using
  their names instead of IDs (e.g., `aws ec2 describe-instances --filters
  Name=web-server`). You can use wildcards () to match multiple instances that
  share a naming pattern (e.g., "web-server"). This is helpful when you want to
  manage instances with descriptive names rather than relying solely on IDs.
</Callout>

#### Start previously stopped instances by their IDs

```bash
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <instance_id_1> <instance_id_2>
```

<Callout>
  This command starts up Amazon EC2 instances that are currently in a stopped
  state. You can specify multiple instance IDs (e.g., `i-0123456789abcdef0` and
  `i-0fedcba0987654321`) to start them all at once. This is useful for resuming
  operation of stopped instances for tasks or applications.
</Callout>

#### Stop running instances by their IDs

```bash
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids <instance_id_1> <instance_id_2>
```

<Callout>
  This command stops running Amazon EC2 instances. You can provide multiple
  instance IDs (e.g., `i-0123456789abcdef0` and `i-0fedcba0987654321`) to stop
  them simultaneously. This is helpful for powering down instances when they're
  not in use, potentially saving on costs.
</Callout>
<Callout title="Important" type="warn">
  Stopping an instance abruptly might cause data loss in applications that
  haven't been properly configured to handle a shutdown. Ensure your
  applications are designed to gracefully handle stop events before using this
  command.
</Callout>

#### Shutdown the specific instances by their IDs

```bash
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance_id_1> <instance_id_2>
```

<Callout>
  This command permanently terminates specified EC2 instances. Provide multiple
  instance IDs (e.g., `i-0123456789abcdef0` and `i-0fedcba0987654321`) to
  terminate them all at once.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Caution" type="warn">
  Termination is irreversible and deletes all data on the instance's storage
  volumes. Use this command with caution and ensure you have proper backups
  before proceeding.
</Callout>

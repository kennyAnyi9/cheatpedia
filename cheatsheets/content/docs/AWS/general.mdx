#### Configure your AWS Key ID, AWS Secret, default region and default output format for the AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure

<Callout>
  This command sets up your credentials and preferences for the AWS CLI. It
  prompts you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default

  your local machine and used by the AWS CLI to interact with AWS services.

  recommended to use more secure credential management methods like environment
  variables or AWS Single Sign-On.
